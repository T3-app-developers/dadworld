This repository now contains **HyperKart 3D**, a single-page React experience rendered with Three.js. It showcases a lightweight kart racing demo with selectable characters, vehicles, and tracks, along with keyboard and touch control schemes.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

> **Note:** In restricted environments without access to the npm registry, dependency installation may fail. In such cases the build scripts will also be unavailable.

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The app uses Tailwind CSS classes via the CDN build that is referenced in `index.html`.
